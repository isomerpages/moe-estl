# What is it like, working as a Quality Engineer in ESTL?
# 
#### Here in ESTL, Quality Engineers are responsible for:  
#### 
*   Writing automated tests to ensure our features are _shiny and chrome_
*   Maintaining a test environment for the verification of newly developed features
*   Supporting our Business Analysts in testing technical features
*   Preparation of test data for various test activities such as performance tests and penetration tests
*   Conducting performance tests and gaining insight on how the system can be improved

If you think this job is mundane - one where you spend the hours clicking and following along a test case and verifying the result, you couldn’t be more wrong.

A Quality Engineer in ESTL ensures that the products we roll out adhere to a stringent standard - one in which quality will never be compromised, and users of our products will have the end-to-end experience we desire them to. This can take the form of verifying that the tests running on our CI/CD build plans are well-maintained and passing with every code change, overseeing the code coverage of the unit tests (and it’s not just the coverage percentage that matters - we also care about the quality of the tests written!), and even proposing changes that we feel would add value to the overall user experience.
