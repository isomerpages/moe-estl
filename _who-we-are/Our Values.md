What are values?
----------------

Our values can be described as behavioural guidance. It lists the core principles that guide and direct the organisation and its culture. In ESTL, we are very much a values-led organisation. This explicit set of value statements create a moral compass to guide us on how we should think and act to achieve our organisation’s vision. It helps us to reflect on what we are good at, and what we need to be good at. 

  

It guides decision-making and establishes a standard against which actions can be assessed. It can be used as a framework to describe whom we hire, reward or let go. The following core values are an internalised framework that is shared and acted on by our leadership.

  

If these values describe you, and the people you want to work with, you will likely do well and feel great in ESTL.

  

Overarching Themes 
-------------------

There are 3 key themes behind our team values. 

  

1.  People-centred 
    
2.  Growth mindset 
    
3.  Taking ownership 
    

  

Being people-centred means we cultivate a deep empathy for people. This empathy informs the way we work with one another to discover real solutions for real people around us. Additionally, we see those we work with as people, with their own needs, objectives, and challenges.

  

We believe in the power of “yet”; that our knowledge, skills, learning, and creativity can all grow with time and experience. We may not be there yet, but we will get there, when we embrace challenges, keep trying and take joy in the learning that happens as we persevere. When we receive feedback, we see them as invaluable in helping us improve and get better. In short, we choose to have a growth mindset, instead of a fixed mindset. 

  

Lastly, we take ownership. If it is to be, it is up to me. I will take the initiative to make change happen. 

  

 
# Start with the User  
      
    

Users are the ‘why’ behind our work. We seek to listen to their voices, understand their needs, and iterate with their feedback.

  

When we embark on a new project or piece of work, our first starting point would be ‘User first’. Recognise that our work only matters when we fully understand our end users who will be using the product. In the user’s unique context, what matters to them and what would benefit them? How may we best serve their needs?

  

# Stronger Together 
      
    

Just as our users matter, the peers and partners we work with matter too. We recognise the individuality and humanity of each person we interact with and we treat them with care and kindness. 

  

Empathy and respect form the bedrock of our interactions with one another. When we empathise with others, we become sensitive and aware of the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of others, to the point that we try to understand and relate to them. 

  

There will be times when there are differences in perspectives, yet we will choose to consider these views. Instead of holding on to the mindset that we are the domain experts, or that we know what the right answers are, we will seek to understand why others think differently. We try to look for common ground and bridge the differences.   

  

We seek unity in diversity; knowing we will emerge stronger when we bring everyone together. With a shared purpose of doing right by our users, we set out to journey together. Journeying together means we will value and build on each other’s distinct strengths, contributions, and perspectives.

  

# Constructively Challenge  
      
    

We question existing assumptions, challenge the status quo, and at times, give contrarian views. While doing so, we still seek to understand and find common ground. 

  

We believe that the best outcomes are achieved when a diversity of perspectives have been thoroughly considered. Since diverse views matter, we are not afraid to play the devil’s advocate, in a kind and positive manner. Debating to think deeper and explore more ideas is a key part of our process. 

  

There is a common understanding that everyone is doing their best for the team, and all are trying to contribute in their own way. We assume no one has ill intentions, and we stay open and respect differing perspectives. We choose to believe that perspectives are offered with the right intentions in mind, always to arrive at the best positive outcomes, under the current circumstances. 

  
  
  
  

# Outcomes over Outputs  
      
    

We are not here to deliver more products or features. We measure success based on the value we create for our users, partners and organisations. 

  

Unlike output driven organisations, we see lots of activity and people working really hard but seldom stop and ascertain whether what they are doing (output) is creating any value for the customer or organisation (outcome) until the output is fully delivered. We are bold in taking a different approach where we learn as quickly and cheaply as possible whether our efforts are driving the results we are aiming for.

  
  

# Embrace Experimentation
    

  

Anyone can experiment. We hope everyone can dream up new possibilities, test hypotheses and learn smartly. 

  

Regardless of which role we play, there are always more hypotheses than the real problems. We take conscious effort and informed risks to test them and are open to possible failure. With that, we can increase our odds of solving the real problem and building the right thing.

  

To successfully innovate, we strive to lower the entry to problem definition, hypothesis testing and go-to-market strategies with increased access to data & tools, simplified processes and supportive people around us. 

  

That means shaping an environment where everyone’s curiosity is encouraged, effort of getting started is low, insights can be shared and stacked purposefully, and valuable increment can be released frequently. 

  
  

# Take Ownership
    

  

In our pursuit of meaningful work, we take initiative to step in, solve problems, and clear the hurdles. Instead of waiting for things to happen, we take proactive steps to make things happen. 

  

Our job may require us to be responsible to deliver an outcome with the highest possible level of quality within limited resources. We should care about the outcome to the extent that we would care if we were the owner of the organisation.

  

Taking ownership doesn't mean we shoulder problems that are beyond our control. It doesn’t mean we should not involve others. It means bringing our insights and ideas forward to someone who does have the capacity, time and resources to own it. 

  

When we take ownership of our work, we make ourselves a dependable team member. It is optimum when everyone can act together, take ownership and responsibility from the inside to the outside — from me to we. 

  
  
  
  

# Actively Give and Seek Feedback
    

  

Most people agree on the importance of feedback. However, that is not enough. To reach the next level, we need to actively give and seek feedback, even though it might be uncomfortable or if it means feeling awkward temporarily.

  

To effectively give feedback, there are various models around how best to deliver it to others, for example the SBI-I model (Situation-Behavior-Impact-Intent). This means we put a lot of thought into what and how we go about giving feedback because we deeply care about how others may interpret it. Our feedback should always be positive and constructive to build trust over the long run. 

  

Sometimes, trust needs to be built first before feedback can be exchanged and we will patiently build the right conditions for trust to thrive. When others trust that you have their best interests at heart, there will be less skepticism and more openness to what you are sharing.  

  

Just as we actively seek feedback from the users of our products, not taking their opinions personally but as points of improvement to make the product even better, we will actively ask for feedback too. Especially across divisions, we will lead by example to ask for feedback so that trust is created for others to receive feedback from us too. 

  

As we build a culture of positive and constructive critique, we create a safe and secure environment for all to start seeking feedback confidently from one another as part of our shared habits.

  
  

# Learn & Teach
    

  

In learning you will teach, in teaching you will learn. We seek to inspire others and invest in one another’s growth with what we have learnt. We believe that we will truly learn the best when we take steps to teach others, thinking deeper about how we do work, breaking down the steps and communicating to others.  

  

What does it really mean to teach? For us, to teach is to influence and each one of us has our own unique scope of influence. Through the way we work, through the way we think, we are already influencing those we work with. Perhaps the next step is to be more explicit in communicating the reasons behind the how, not just showing, but telling.

  

Arguably, we can learn almost everything from the Internet, yet it is hard to learn about how to navigate through bureaucracy towards sustainable innovation. This requires wisdom and grit that is hardly documented openly on the Internet.

  

Using the understanding gained by those who have gone before, team members can stand on their shoulders and make further progress. 

  

We strive to hire the best candidates but at the same time, we need to purposefully nurture others to become better versions of themselves so that they can lead and continue to generate amazing heat and ignite a fire in the education sector.

Safe spaces and the importance of psychological safety 
-------------------------------------------------------

For everyone to bring their whole selves to work, it’s important to create an environment where everyone feels safe enough to show their authentic selves. What does it mean to create a safe space? 

  

Firstly, we create opportunities for team members to make themselves heard. Inputs are actively solicited so everyone feels encouraged to share and that their views matter.  

  

Secondly, we are open to differing opinions and no question is a dumb question. Team members are free to share their ideas and concerns without fear of judgement. Team members are open to listen and seek to understand. Even when we don’t agree, we acknowledge that what’s expressed is the person’s truth and we respect that. 

  

Finally, we hope to build such trust within the team that we are comfortable to be vulnerable around one another. That we can share our challenges and emotions with courage. And we can expect support and encouragement to brave through them. 

  

Aligned Autonomy
----------------

  

Alignment enables autonomy. The greater the alignment we have, the more autonomy we can afford to grant. Our leaders communicate where the north stars are and why we need to get there. With strong alignment towards that, teams can maximise autonomy to collaborate with each other, make independent decisions and find the best solutions.

  

At the forefront in discovering and solving complex problems, there is no way to follow others’ playbooks which may be narrowly defined. High variation in how we work creates new opportunities for us to learn from different practices. We dislike conformity as it kills innovation and drives away the best staff. 

  

We are trusted to be autonomous so that we can determine how we work as fast as possible without asking for permission. We drive innovation from below, and are supported from above to make bold decisions, fail fast, learn and iterate.

  

Autonomy over control breeds positive motivation, community culture, and mutual trust. We believe trust at scale is the fundamental building block for agile at scale. A high level of autonomy with stubborn alignment to our vision enables us to move fast and extremely focused in tackling the problems that matter to the sector.

  
  
  
  
  

Playfulness at work. The recipe of creativity and happiness.
------------------------------------------------------------

  

Fun allows us to think playfully. Children aren’t afraid of making mistakes when they play. That’s how they learn. Similarly, being playful without being limited by fear of failure can give us a huge boost of creativity.

  

Fun can also deepen our connection with each other. As we enjoy our time together, we can become happier and more engaged. Having fun together often unites team members during challenging times. The positivity brought in would help us to stay on track despite stormy weather ahead.

  

When teammates trust each other, it opens us up, makes us laugh. We consciously make time and space for team members to play at work, as we believe that playfulness is an important way to recharge our soul in our pursuit of meaningful work amid obstacles.
